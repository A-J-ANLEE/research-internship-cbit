## CAPSTONE PROJECT:-
# zero-shot handwritten medical term translation

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue)
![EasyOCR](https://img.shields.io/badge/EasyOCR-1.4.1-green)
![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCV-4.5.5-red)

An OCR-based system that extracts and organizes medical prescription information into structured tabs.

## Features

- **Automatic Text Extraction**: Recognizes both printed and handwritten prescriptions
- **Structured Data Organization**: Categorizes information into:
  - Patient Information
  - Diagnosis
  - Prescription Medications
  - Doctor Details
- **Smart Parsing**: Handles multiple prescription formats and medical abbreviations
- **Error Resilient**: Provides "Not found" placeholders for missing information

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - Tesseract OCR (for some systems)

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install easyocr opencv-python numpy
   ```
